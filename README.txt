I have submitted only 1 java file for my project, as I only needed 1.  

------To run my program (with 100% certainty it will work):------------

Open Eclipse IDE
Create a new Java Project 
Inside the src file, create a new package 'layout'

Extract my zipped file to any location.
Inside of that package. copy the only source file 'Game.java'
Then, right click on the project name and create a new source file named 'res'.
Drop o.jpg and x.jpg in 'res'.

Run the program.

To make things simpler I have created a .jar and .exe to be able to play the game easily!
